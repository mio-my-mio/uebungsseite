                        <h3>1985</h3>
                        <p>William Afton goes on a murdering spree inside of Freddy 
                            Fazbear's Pizza. This is later dubbed by the public and 
                            media as the "Missing Children's Incident". The bodies 
                            are stuffed inside of the newer four animatronics and 
                            the old Fredbear suit. Customers notice foul smells start 
                            to come from the suits, and parents contact police reporting 
                            blood and mucus around the eyes and mouths of the animatronics. 
                            Freddy Fazbear's Pizza shuts down.</p>

                        and used for spare parts.</p>

                    <h3>1987</h3>
                    <p>The events of Five Nights at Freddy's 2 take place. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza 
                        reopens with a new location in early November, featuring the new Toy 
                        animatronics, as well as The Puppet once again. The remaining five animatronics 
                        from the old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza location were initially planned to be reused, 
                        being retrofitted with the new technology, but were inevitably stored in the back 
                        room, being used for parts instead.</p>
